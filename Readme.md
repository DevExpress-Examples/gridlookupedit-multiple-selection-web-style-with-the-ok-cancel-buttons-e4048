# GridLookUpEdit - Multiple selection (web style) with the OK/Cancel buttons


<p>The current example extends the functionality described in <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E3074">GridLookUpEdit: multiple selection using checkbox (web style)</a> example.<br />
In the mentioned example, GridlookUpEdit.EditValue is changed immediately after a user has selected a row in a drop-down GridView instance.</p><p>This example demonstrates how to implement the functionality to confirm/reject changing GridlookUpEdit.EditValue when a popup Form is closing. This functionality is implemented by adding two predefined buttons: Ok and Cancel.</p><br />
<p>In addition, this example illustrates how to use a different collection as a GridlookUpEdit.DataSource property value.</p>
